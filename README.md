## About Kubeflow

[Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/) makes artificial intelligence and machine learning simple, portable, and scalable.

We are an _ecosystem_ of [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) based projects for each stage in the
[AI/ML Lifecycle](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/architecture/#kubeflow-components-in-the-ml-lifecycle)
with support for best-in-class open source [tools and frameworks](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/architecture/#kubeflow-ecosystem).
Please refer to the official [documentation](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/) for more information.

## Kubeflow Projects

The [Kubeflow Ecosystem](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/started/architecture/#kubeflow-ecosystem) is composed of several projects known as _Kubeflow Projects_.

The following table lists the projects and their respective source code repositories:
